Conclusion for Today 
*1)* Slow traffic for both stores, thus we are unable to achieve the target.
*2)* Visual merchandise and overall presentation for kiosk was revamped. Fixed the messy garlands and added new ones to frame the 'G'.
    As per Miss Daphne's request:
    *2a)* Gold collection was removed from Push Cart for now, as Raya merchandise takes priority on the runaway table.
    *2b)* Vans were given its own stand, as without the gold collection, It left behind an empty space.
    *2c)* More G Cubes were filled in the empty area infront to compensate the goods that were removed.

Information

*4)* Store cleanliness should always be in tip top condition.
